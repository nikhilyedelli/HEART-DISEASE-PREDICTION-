## Introduction

Heart disease is a leading cause of death worldwide, making early detection crucial for improving patient outcomes. This project uses machine learning models trained on health metrics like age, blood pressure, cholesterol level, and more to predict the likelihood of heart disease.

## Features

- Predicts heart disease risk based on patient data.
- Data preprocessing and feature selection included.
- Multiple machine learning models for comparison.
- Visualizations to explore dataset features and model performance.

## Data

The dataset used is the [Heart Disease UCI dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease), which contains health metrics for over 300 patients. The dataset includes attributes like age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol, and more.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   https://github.com/nikhilyedelli/HEART-DISEASE-PREDICTION-/edit/main/README.md
## Usage

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Run the preprocessing script to clean and prepare the dataset.
   ```bash
   python preprocess.py

### Model
The project includes several classification models such as:

- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine
- K-Nearest Neighbors
