# HEART-DISEASE-PREDICTION-
This project uses machine learning to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on various health indicators. Built with Python and scikit-learn, the model applies logistic regression to classify patients as having heart disease or not.
Features
Data Loading & Preprocessing: Loads the dataset, handles missing values, and prepares features and target variables for model training.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Basic statistics, shape, and class distribution of the dataset.
Model Training: Implements logistic regression for binary classification.
Model Evaluation: Calculates accuracy on both training and test data, allowing for performance assessment.
Predictive System: A system that takes in new patient data as input and outputs a prediction on heart disease risk.
Installation
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/username/heart-disease-prediction.git
Install the required dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Data Preparation: Load and preprocess the heart disease dataset.
Training: Train the logistic regression model on the processed data.
Prediction: Run predictions on new patient data using the trained model.
Requirements
Python 3.x
NumPy
Pandas
scikit-learn
Project Structure
heart.csv: Dataset containing patient health data.
heart_disease_prediction.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook for model training and evaluation.
predictive_system.py: Script for running the predictive system on new input data.
